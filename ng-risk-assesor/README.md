# API Security Assessment System

## Overview

Welcome to the API Security Assessment System! This project leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks within APIs. Our aim is to enhance the security posture of organizations by providing advanced detection and assessment capabilities using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.

## Features

- **Risk Detection**: Uses LLMs to analyze API documentation and traffic to identify potential security risks.
- **Threat Classification**: Classifies detected threats into categories such as injection attacks, broken authentication, and data exposure.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies deviations from normal API behavior patterns.
- **Incident Analysis**: Provides insights and recommendations for mitigating detected risks.
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves accuracy and relevance through ongoing learning and updates based on new data and threats.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
