Intelligent Cybersecurity Risk Detector
Overview
Welcome to the Intelligent Cybersecurity Risk Detector! This project leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Our aim is to enhance the security posture of organizations by providing advanced detection and assessment capabilities using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.

Features
Risk Detection: Uses LLMs to analyze textual data from various sources (logs, incident reports, etc.) to identify potential cybersecurity risks.
Threat Classification: Classifies detected threats into categories such as malware, phishing, and insider threats.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies deviations from normal behavior patterns in system and network activities.
Incident Analysis: Provides insights and recommendations for mitigating detected risks.
Continuous Learning: Improves accuracy and relevance through ongoing learning and updates based on new data and threats.
